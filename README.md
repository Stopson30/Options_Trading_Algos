data: This directory contains the market data that is used to train and test the models.
models: This directory contains the machine learning models that are used to make predictions.
scripts: This directory contains the scripts that are used to train and test the models, and to make predictions.
Usage
To train a model, you can use the train.py script. To test a model, you can use the test.py script. To make predictions, you can use the predict.py script.

Results
